### Live Demo

## Inspiration

This project draws heavy inspiration from:

- 🧪 **Parrot OS aesthetics** — that futuristic hacker vibe
- 🎛️ **Terminal interfaces** — black background, green glow, monospaced confidence
- 💡 The idea: *"What if a portfolio felt like a terminal, but worked like a modern website?"*

Colors? Pulled from Parrot OS and tweaked for that sleek neon edge.  
Mood? Hacker conference meets design elegance.  
Tools? Just your classics — **HTML & CSS**, nothing more.

## Concept

> "A stylish portfolio site that *feels* like a terminal, but *functions* like a pro site."
This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s a **tribute to clean UI** built with constraints — only HTML and CSS — no JavaScript, no frameworks.
It was born out of the **PLP Academy Hackathon**, where the challenge was to stand out, build fast, and flex creative muscles within tight technical boundaries.
And oh yes — **a LOT of research** went into every layout decision, animation, media query, and gradient line.

## 📱 Responsive Design

Mobile or 4K? This portfolio **scales**.

- ✅ Fully responsive (media queries from 480px to 1440px)
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons and toggles
- ✅ Adjusts layout and grids on the fly
- ✅ Navigation turns into a clean mobile drawer

Everything looks sharp whether you're on a MacBook, Android phone, or command line browser (okay maybe not the last one... yet).

##  Design Highlights

- **Dark terminal theme** with green accents  
- **Glowing borders** and animated rays for that cyberpunk terminal feel  
- **CSS-only mobile nav toggle** (no JS!)
- **Custom grid system** for projects, skills, certificates  
- **Animated scanline on cards** and even conic border light effects

## Final Words

This project taught me that with just **HTML and CSS**, you can go pretty far.
Sometimes, the restrictions unlock the creativity.

> _"If it glows, scrolls, and feels like a terminal... then it just might be my portfolio."_

## 💬 Final Words

This project taught me that with just **HTML and CSS**, you can still make people say _"Wait, this doesn’t have JavaScript?"_

Sometimes, limits spark the best ideas. This was one of those times.

```
Made with:
- Caffeine
- Typing...
- Deleting...
- Rewriting...
- And a little obsession

Hack the world, one <div> at a time.
